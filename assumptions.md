### belows are assumptions made when writing the corresponding modules 

#### auth_login_v1 

#### auth_register_v1 

#### channel_invite_v1

#### channel_details_v1

#### channel_messages_v1

#### channel_join_v1
Users who are already members of a channel will not attempt to join again
There will be no duplicate entries
Users will be unable to join servers that are private

#### channels_list_v1
The returned channels will list in the order they were created
Users can call the command without being a part of any official channel, it will only return an empty list

# COMP1531 Assignment Iteration 1 Assumptions

## auth_login_v1 (winston)

## auth_register_v1 (winston)
* The auth_user_id is generated by int(uuid.uuid(4)) which creates a unique number 

## channel_invite_v1 (darrell)
* No duplicate entries
* No inviting themselves
* All members can invite users in any type of channel
* Only invite members that are not already invited

## channel_details_v1 (darrell)

## channel_messages_v1 (brendan)

## channel_join_v1 (kellen)
* Users who attempt to join who are already members/owners will retain their status within the channel

## channels_list_v1 (kellen)
* Users can call the command without being a part of any official channel

## channels_listall_v1 (nikki)
* Any valid auth_user_id can see all the channels - public or private 
* The returned channels list is in the order as they were created 

## channels_create_v1 (nikki)
* The user who creates the channel automatically becomes the owner of the channel 
* Channel_id is generated by int(uuid.uuid(1)) which creates a unique number based on the hostID and current time 
* Different channels can have the same name
