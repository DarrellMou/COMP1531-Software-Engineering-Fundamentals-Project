# COMP1531 Assignment Iteration 2 Assumptions
## auth_register_v2 (winston)
* The auth_user_id is generated by int(uuid.uuid(4)) which creates a unique number. 
* Users can have the same first_name, last_name and password.
* auth_user_id will be stored in the users key of the data dictionary.
* Finishing registration does not automatically log the user in afterwards, registration and login are two separate steps.

## channel_invite_v2 (darrell)
* No existing members can invite themselves.
* All members can invite users in any type of channel.
* Only can invite members that are not already invited.
* When invited, the user's auth_user_id will be added to the channel key of the data dictionary.

## channel_details_v2 (darrell)
* The member of all_members appears the same order as they joined the channel.
* The member of owner_members appears the same order as they became the owner of the channel.

## channel_messages_v2 (brendan)
* Given start will never be negative. 
* Start refers to the starting index of the data['channels'][channel_id]['messages'] list.
* An out of index message within the messages list of a channel (i.e data['channels'][channel_id]['messages']) will never be accessed and therefore, there is no need to raise an index error. E.g. trying to access data['channels'][channel_id]['messages'][1] when there # is only 1 message in that specific channel_id, which has an index of 0.
* Messages are originally appended to our message list when they are sent.
* If there are no messages in the channel then that means the most recent message has been returned, therefore 'end' = -1.
* If there are 50 messages in a channel and the start is 0, then the 50th message IS the last message - return 'end': -1 rather than 'end': 50.

## channel_join_v2 (kellen)
* Users who are already members of a channel will not attempt to join again.
* There will be no duplicate entries.
* Global owners do not become an owner member, but has owner permissions (implemented later).

## channels_list_v2 (kellen)
* The channels will appear in the order they were created.
* Users can call the command without being a part of any official channel - it will only return an empty list.

## channels_listall_v2 (nikki)
* Any valid auth_user_id can see all the channels - public or private. 
* The returned channels list is in the order as they were created. 

## channels_create_v2 (nikki)
* The user who creates the channel automatically becomes the owner of the channel.
* Channel_id is generated by int(uuid.uuid(1)) which creates a unique number based on the hostID and current time.
* Different channels can have the same name. 

## message_senddm_v1 (brendan, nikki)
* Messages that are sent using message_senddm are appended to the message list within the dm
* Message inputs "" and " " will append to the message list

## search_v2 (nikki)
* Query search will return messages in channels even before the user has joined
* Message input "" will return all messages
* Message input " " will return messages with spaces in them, e.g. " Hi", "Back End"
* Global owners can only see messages from channels and dms they've joined

## admin_user_remove_v1 (nikki)
* Removed users do not have valid tokens and hence cannot access any feature of Dreams. They also no longer possess a valid u_id, so other users cannot interact with them unless it is through user/profile/v2.
* A removed user's profile is only retrievable with user/profile/v2 and nothing else.

## admin_userpermission_change_v1 (nikki)
* N/A

## data 
* Owner_members are also part of all_members.
